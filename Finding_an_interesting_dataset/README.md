# I'm interested in this dataset because I've been watching shows and movies on Netflix for quite a bit now, and I wanted to learn more about the streaming platform that has taken the world by a storm. Netflix had only gotten bigger ever since they were founded and are currently one of the leading streaming service companies across the nation. That being said they have created more and more original shows/movies of their own that have been met with high appraisals and awards.
