I'm interested in this dataset because I want to learn more about the entertainment industry specifically in cinema and tv shows. This dataset however, is specifically on tv shows and also determines which streaming platform the show is currently on.
The dataset also contains information on the shows such as ratings, years, age rating, and etc. 

Questions:
1: Which streaming platform has the most shows?
2: Does the movie year determine which streaming platform it would likely be in?
3: Who has the most shows for kids?
4: Who has the most shows for teens?
5: Who has the most shows for adults?
6: Which platform has the oldest shows?
7: Who has the worst tv shows?
8: Which platform has the best IMDB rating shows?
9: Which platform has the best Rotten Tomatoes rating shows?
10: How does Netflix compare to the other platforms in terms of quality of shows?
