# I'm interested in this dataset because I've been watching shows and movies on Netflix for a while now, and I wanted to learn more about the streaming platform that has taken the world by a storm. Netflix had only gotten bigger ever since they were founded and are currently one of the leading streaming service companies across the nation. That being said they have created more and more original shows/movies of their own that have been met with high appraisals and awards. Making me all the more intrigued about exploring Netflix's content. 

# Questions:
# 1: Does Netflix have more shows or movies?
# 2: When would be the best time for a producer to release content? (Months with the least amount of content added)
# 3: Which audience does Netflix have the most content for? 
# 4: What is the general duration of a movie on Netflix?
# 5: What is the genre distribution for the content on Netflix?
# 6: Are there any correlations between a country's produced content and its ratings?
# 7: Does an actor/actress prefer working more with a particular producer?
# 8: How does Netflix content compare over the years?
# 9: Is there a correlation between the genre and the duration of its content?
# 10: How does the split between movie and TV show vary by country?
